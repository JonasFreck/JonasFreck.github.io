<p>One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned at my time at IA is how people are so much more willing to help you than you think, it’s just a matter of reaching out. I learned this when I first reached out to the Alpharetta City Arborist, <strong>David Shostak</strong>, asking about planting trees for an outdoor classroom project we were planning.</p>
<p>Feeling inspired, the email I sent was ambitious and asked about potential interest in working with our school aside from just answering my questions about the trees. I didn’t expect much and was surprised when he responded and said he would be delighted to help. This led to a series of emails which in the scope of Junior year, resulted in a Q&amp;A session being organized for members of the environmental stewardship club.</p>
<p>I made sure to keep in contact and through that endeavor forged a valuable connection with years of experience in the environmental industry. We’ve met numerous times since then and have begun planning new opportunities for students such as volunteering to help with a corporate-funded tree-giveaway, as well as looking into more sustainable sources of buying wood for the engineering program. This has offered not only enhanced means of making the school more environmentally sustainable but exposing me personally to the environmental industry.</p>
<div id="day-of-the-shadowing" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Day of the Shadowing<a href="shadowing-the-arborist.html#day-of-the-shadowing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>October 12th was the day I shadowed <strong>Mr. Shostak</strong>. City hall had always been such an illusive building, and for the first time I would be not only going inside, but into the areas permitted for staff members only. It was an exciting experience, and I was glad to see <strong>Mr. Shostak</strong> was similarly enthused about my shadowing. That’s something imperative to understand that a lot of these professionals don’t receive interest in their fields often, especially when you’re looking at a more niche field such as environmental careers.</p>
<p>We discussed leading technologies in the industry such as using x-ray to evaluate tree roots without having to physically harm them in any way. It was interesting to see what his work looked like, which was really a lot of consulting and arguing with independent contractors.</p>
<p>He took me to an “infraction site” where a demolition company had placed a root barrier, meant to protect tree roots, on top of the roots, effectively severing them. The demolition contractor said it was the homeowner’s mistake that had caused the issue as he was trying to avoid the hefty fines, he would be subject to if the trees needed to be removed due to infection. <strong>Mr. Shostak</strong> told me about how this line of work you must be vigilant for “BS,” something I realized can be applied to all domains of environmentalism.</p>

<div id="combatting-to-greenwashing" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="5.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Combatting to Greenwashing<a href="shadowing-the-arborist.html#combatting-to-greenwashing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Greenwashing has become a prominent term in the vocabulary for environmentalism, it describes how corporations and individuals who present harm to the environment “promote” environmentalism for perverse causes. This has been seen most bluntly with big oil companies but continues to most corporations aside from a select few who find more profit in a genuine care for the environment such as many outdoor wear companies.</p>
<p>Resilience to these greenwashing attempts is strengthened by building a community with others with a genuine passion. That’s why it’s so important to seek out these connections and not be afraid to reach out to others, because they’re a lot more interested in talking to you than you would think they are.</p>

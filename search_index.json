Within each chapter are descriptions, guides, and reflections on environmental projects I participated in during my time as a student. 1.1 Usage While the book is targeted at students from Innovation Academy, it can be used as a source of inspiration for students in many different situations. Even for the IA student, this should not be read as a manual to be followed, but as a piece to be used for advice and direction in navigating projects similar to my own. "],["new-tapei-city-carbon-neutral-forum.html", "Chapter 2 New Tapei City Carbon Neutral Forum 2.1 Plan Revision 2.2 Building the Prototype 2.3 Presentation", " Chapter 2 New Tapei City Carbon Neutral Forum In the Spring of 2022 Innovation Academy was visited by a school from Taipei. Their students came and toured our campus and frankly I’m not sure which school it was, but I believe they were here to observe a “vocational” school in another country. As someone who was not directly involved with the visit it was rather forgettable. That was until I received an email from Ms. Paxton over the summer: an invitation to the “New Taipei City: Carbon Neutral Summit”, also known as New Taipei City MAGIC. MAGIC being an acronym for “Maker, Action, Green, International, and Cross-domain.” It was an exciting opportunity which I promptly agreed to. It wouldn’t be until August that I would hear more about the project, and we quickly organized and began brainstorming. Staying two hours after school I, along with Joaquin Friedman, Cyrus Zhou, Sejal Whitaker, Lauren Trute, and Megan Roka came deliberated over what would become our project. This presented the first point in the project where we really could’ve gone about things better. Deciding what problem to focus on took much longer than anticipated, and ultimately, we were left with a half-baked topic. It came down to High Density Polyethylene recycling using a solar oven, or a personal seaweed growing system for urban agriculture. We decided to split into groups and take a week to research the individual projects before coming together for a subsequent debate. Neither group did a whole lot of research, and we ended up deciding on the seaweed growing system due to the potential to talk about urban agriculture in our presentation which was a largely under-discussed topic in the sustainability field, especially for this summit, which from what we saw was dominated by gimmicky inventions that couldn’t really apply to the world outside of pure hypotheticals. The submission requirements for the project asked for both a written document and a developed project, however the due dates were about a month apart. Naturally we started with the written document as by the time we decided on the project subject it would be due in just two weeks. We met on the next Flex Friday and spent the morning session researching the benefits of urban agriculture as well as the health effects of adding seaweed to a diet. Both were interesting topics, and by far the opportunity to research these fields were the most memorable takeaways from this project. Not being able to finish during the session we went to work over the coming two weeks, finishing just in time and getting the document submitted. 2.1 Plan Revision A few days after submitting the written plan we received an email from a correspondent NTPC forum. They informed us that rather than a limit of 10 pages as was described in the instructions we were provided; the limit was instead 2 pages. Fortunately, we were given a few more days to update the written plan, but this was a frustrating development. Over the course of the next week, I worked with Cyrus Zhou to condense the written plan down to just 2 pages. It was unfortunate to have to have to take out all of the work we had done, but it wasn’t a complete waste as the information removed from the written plan was still useful for the presentation and fabrication of the project. Finding information on the forum was one of the most difficult aspects of the project and required numerous hours of searching around online to find resources to draw examples from. As this is something I hope we continue to participate in for the foreseeable future I’ve attached all the links I was able to find in my search below: https://www.youtube.com/@sheng_jutseng8277 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8PszsL86tQ&amp;ab_channel=Peggiehunge https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ZL_759GhU&amp;ab_channel=%E9%99%B6%E5%B7%A5%E7%A7%91%E4%B8%BB%E4%BB%BB%E5%85%AC%E5%8B%99%E4%BF%A1%E7%AE%B1%E6%96%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%B8%82%E9%B6%AF%E6%AD%8C%E5%B7%A5%E5%95%86 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjC_zZYYXmA&amp;ab_channel=%E6%96%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%B8%82%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E5%B1%80 https://www.ntpc.gov.tw/ch/home.jsp?id=e8ca970cde5c00e1&amp;dataserno=8a975b566bbfea08c6c8c2c76f8fcc16 https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/10/18/2003724177 https://news.immigration.gov.tw/NewsSection/Detail/0a7bd59c-a892-4b26-a0f7-325fd09df71a?category=9&amp;lang=EN https://legacy.sccoe.org/sccsba/docs/news/Newsletter_2023_1.pdf https://sites.google.com/ctjhs.ntpc.edu.tw/ntpc-magic/about-us?authuser=0 https://www.ntpc.edu.tw/home.jsp?id=d127e0ce0f4f407b&amp;act=be4f48068b2b0031&amp;dataserno=ebbffbc12d05d323f3b7507b07de71ee https://youtu.be/CjC_zZYYXmA?t=14442 2.2 Building the Prototype With the written plan submitted we got started on the physical prototype, the second step of the project submission requirements. For future submissions to the NTPC forum I recommend placing the feasibility of creation at the forefront of your project decision. In our case it was more of an afterthought, which presented some unique challenges. The first challenge was having to adapt our design to materials we already had. We had to do this due to starting the building too late and not possessing enough funds to acquire exactly every material we wanted. This manifested itself in the building process through requiring we use a tank designed for aquaponics, as well as grow lights and a pump instead of a protein skimmer and macroalgae as we had designed. For a speedily constructed prototype these were perfectly fine accommodations and did not significantly affect the product. The second challenge was getting the seaweed to grow in the tank. We had to order the seaweed online and by the time it got here we needed to put it in very quickly and didn’t have enough foundational knowledge to ensure it adapted well to the conditions of the tank. Luckily it was able to survive well, and as you can see in the image only a fraction of the seaweed floated up to the top, while the rest was able to connect with the rocks at the bottom and begin growing normally. A third issue was these rocks themselves. The calcium coming off the rocks resulted in an extremely foggy water, making visibility difficult which we’d need to fix to be able to present. This was chiefly due to the rocks we purchased and the way we ended up fixing this was through aggressive washing of the rocks over the course of an hour. The final hurdle we had to address was the salinity of the water. We purchased aquarium salt for the tank but upon reading the back found that the measurements provided were for freshwater. The seaweed naturally required the salinity of seawater to thrive in our tank. After numerous pH tests we were able to center in on the salinity, however this would’ve been made far less stressful and rushed with ample foreground research, which is my main piece of advice for future students participating in the forum. 2.3 Presentation Finding ourselves at the tail-end of the project we had now completed the written plan as well as the physical prototype, and now we only had to finish the recorded presentation of our work. This was required as Fulton County had declined any possibility of travel to Taipei, not that it would’ve been feasible regardless of their decision. Over the course of the project motivation presented a consistent challenge towards completion. This is true of any project, but I’ve observed it can be especially potent in projects such as these with an environmental or more broadly a sort of counter-cultural focus. Environmentalism is often not the popular stance for a variety of reasons out of scope of this reflection, and because of this unpopularity the execution of these projects requires a lot of intrinsic motivation. This was something we were fortunate to possess a satisfactory quantity of, even if only marginally so. Because of this I encourage you to support your colleagues in these endeavors as work can often feel thankless despite its importance. Creating the presentation and recording were hindered and slowed by this lack of motivation. We were fortunate to have Joaquin Freidman take lead of the project and ensure everyone kept up enough effort to see the project through to completion. With the deadline on the horizon, we finished the PowerPoint and selected three members of the team to present in the video. There was a preference for underclassmen but unfortunately, we weren’t able to drum enough interest for the project due to not starting work soon enough. Aiden Seabusch, Lauren Trute, and Joaquin Freidman came together on during the tutoring session of the Flex Friday a week before the deadline and recorded the video. Unfortunately, the video was rough, and it wasn’t something we felt confident about presenting to the summit, prompting a second take. Because this was our school’s first year participating in this annual event, we really wanted to ensure we presented our best work. After refining the PowerPoint and recording a second take, we were left with something we were proud of. We reviewed the video and made sure it was good and submitted it to the correspondent. The video was in and with it the final part of the project. Participating in the NTPC Summit represented a great opportunity to share ideas with students from around the world and get our name out there in the environmental space. If you have the opportunity to participate I’d highly recommend it, especially if you’re able to travel to Taipei! "],["outdoor-classroom-project-ptso-grant.html", "Chapter 3 Outdoor Classroom Project &amp; PTSO Grant 3.1 Planning 3.2 Approaching Deadlines 3.3 Design Methodology 3.4 Isometric Sketches", " Chapter 3 Outdoor Classroom Project &amp; PTSO Grant Approached by Ms. Paxton in early September I was given the opportunity to lead a team in designing furniture for an outdoor space at our school. This was an exciting offer coming off the heels of a failed grant application towards the end of my junior year which was going to be used for development of an outdoor classroom. This project wouldn’t create all our idealized designs; however, it would represent an important step, which often in pursuing goals of environmentalism, taking small steps is important. You’re not going to start a revolution while in high school, but we do have the means to influence our surroundings in meaningful ways, and in turn plant the seeds necessary to change people’s minds for the better. I’d be looking at about a thousand dollars of grant money, which was more than enough to create a solid set of durable furniture fitted for use by multiple students at a time. 3.1 Planning The team met for the first time on the first engineering Flex Friday of the year. During the session we introduced ourselves then went out to the space to evaluate the area we’d be developing. We found barren, dry soil and a lot of sunlight. We went back to our meeting room and began brainstorming. We wanted to create a design that could interact with the soil and help remediate it. With no design settled on by the end of the first meeting we decided on a future date to meet again and debriefed with the goal of producing our own designs on our own and deciding based on those. 3.2 Approaching Deadlines A few days later I was informed that the PTSO grant deadline was far closer than we had thought. I’d have only five days to decide on a design and the grant paperwork submitted. This was a valuable learning opportunity, and it forced me to be both resilient and adaptive. Thinking on your feet is necessary of good leadership and acting that out I created a Microsoft Form with four different options of furniture based on images I found on Pinterest. This was done to preserve the democratic nature of the project, as I knew that if I made the call all on my own it would alienate everyone else in the project and keeping them engaged was of vital importance to ensure competition of the project as well as inspiring many of the underclassmen participating in the development. Two days after the form was posted I collected the results and went to work creating the design. It would be a table with two benches, and a raised bed centered in the table. The raised bed would allow interaction with the soil and help remediate the soil quality through higher quality soil maintained on top of it. 3.3 Design Methodology The design was created based on posts found on Pinterest as well as building plans and YouTube videos. In the end I decided on a simple design that could result in almost all the pieces being made of 2x4s, making construction and purchase of the materials very simple. Consisting mainly of long 2x4 planks the itemized list was created and submitted to the PTSO the next day. After filling out a few text boxes detailing the motivations of the project, it was finished, and the grant submitted. 3.4 Isometric Sketches "],["nature-trail.html", "Chapter 4 Nature Trail 4.1 Beginning 4.2 Bridge Construction 4.3 Refinement 4.4 Deeper Reflection", " Chapter 4 Nature Trail Created initially in 2022 by the Innovation Academy Environmental Stewardship and Mountain Biking Clubs, the nature trail is a mixed-use trail out behind the school which follows from the retention pond over a wooden bridge then to the auxiliary soccer field and back around. The nature trail represents some of the most substantial environmental work done thus far at the school, and it’s been an extremely rewarding experience to see the trail grow and development over time. 4.1 Beginning I began work on the trail volunteering with the Environmental Stewardship club to cleanup construction debris leftover from the demolition of old Milton Highschool. As we pulled up the metal pipes and discarded net, we found that the area would make an excellent nature trail, and Joaquin Freidman, Parker Grodi, and Wasim Alam began work designing the trail and planning out the route, though at this point the path was still extremely rough and not fit for a walking trail, let alone a mountain biking trail. 4.2 Bridge Construction Later in spring of 2022 the Environmental Stewardship club began work on a bridge to gap the river between the retention pond and auxiliary soccer field. This process consisted of multiple steps: Clearing out the area with branch cutters and pulling weeds and brush that was in the way of the bridge placement. Create the bridge out of 2x4s and stronger wooden posts. Digging holes for the wooden posts, making sure to work around roots encountered while digging. Pouring cement around the posts to ensure the bridge is sturdy. Once the posts are sturdy the bridge was affixed to the posts, and at last it was finished. 4.3 Refinement Even after constructing the bridge the nature trail still needed work. We came back over the summer and conducted more landscaping, clearing out fallen branches and using them to better define the path. After some weed-whacking the trail started looking a lot better. It was finally something that could be used by the public. Graphics were designed for a trail sign and a wooden post was designed to hold the graphic. Now it looked like a professional trail. This is essentially where we’re at today. Currently we’re looking into adding a doggy-bag station to make the trail more accessible to dog-walkers, as well as continuing to refine the upkeep of the trail. 4.4 Deeper Reflection My favorite part of the trail is that it’s something that could be around for as long as IA, and even beyond that. It gives the Environmental Stewardship club an opportunity to give new members hands-on experience and help foster a passion for the environment through interacting with it directly. There’s not better way to communicate our own passions than by sharing it with others and letting it experience it for themselves. The Mountain Biking Trail club currently holds some of the best underclassmen leadership and engagement, and it gives me hope for the future of the trail, and likewise the future of environmentalism within Innovation Academy. "],["shadowing-the-arborist.html", "Chapter 5 Shadowing the Arborist 5.1 Day of the Shadowing 5.2 Combatting to Greenwashing", " Chapter 5 Shadowing the Arborist One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned at my time at IA is how people are so much more willing to help you than you think, it’s just a matter of reaching out. I learned this when I first reached out to the Alpharetta City Arborist, David Shostak, asking about planting trees for an outdoor classroom project we were planning. Feeling inspired, the email I sent was ambitious and asked about potential interest in working with our school aside from just answering my questions about the trees. I didn’t expect much and was surprised when he responded and said he would be delighted to help. This led to a series of emails which in the scope of Junior year, resulted in a Q&amp;A session being organized for members of the environmental stewardship club. I made sure to keep in contact and through that endeavor forged a valuable connection with years of experience in the environmental industry. We’ve met numerous times since then and have begun planning new opportunities for students such as volunteering to help with a corporate-funded tree-giveaway, as well as looking into more sustainable sources of buying wood for the engineering program. This has offered not only enhanced means of making the school more environmentally sustainable but exposing me personally to the environmental industry. 5.1 Day of the Shadowing October 12th was the day I shadowed Mr. Shostak. City hall had always been such an illusive building, and for the first time I would be not only going inside, but into the areas permitted for staff members only. It was an exciting experience, and I was glad to see Mr. Shostak was similarly enthused about my shadowing. That’s something imperative to understand that a lot of these professionals don’t receive interest in their fields often, especially when you’re looking at a more niche field such as environmental careers. We discussed leading technologies in the industry such as using x-ray to evaluate tree roots without having to physically harm them in any way. It was interesting to see what his work looked like, which was really a lot of consulting and arguing with independent contractors. He took me to an “infraction site” where a demolition company had placed a root barrier, meant to protect tree roots, on top of the roots, effectively severing them. The demolition contractor said it was the homeowner’s mistake that had caused the issue as he was trying to avoid the hefty fines, he would be subject to if the trees needed to be removed due to infection. Mr. Shostak told me about how this line of work you must be vigilant for “BS,” something I realized can be applied to all domains of environmentalism. 5.2 Combatting to Greenwashing Greenwashing has become a prominent term in the vocabulary for environmentalism, it describes how corporations and individuals who present harm to the environment “promote” environmentalism for perverse causes. This has been seen most bluntly with big oil companies but continues to most corporations aside from a select few who find more profit in a genuine care for the environment such as many outdoor wear companies. Resilience to these greenwashing attempts is strengthened by building a community with others with a genuine passion. That’s why it’s so important to seek out these connections and not be afraid to reach out to others, because they’re a lot more interested in talking to you than you would think they are. "],["interviews.html", "Chapter 6 Interviews 6.1 Student Interviews 6.2 Industry Interviews", " Chapter 6 Interviews In the aim of identifying what factors specifically motivate people towards environmental concern I interviewed numerous of my peers as well as industry professionals to identify what got them passionate about environmentalism. This took place through both free form interviews with the industry professionals as well as structured interviews with peers whom I had identified as exemplar students interested in environmentalism. The interviews were initially only going to be directed at peers however as part of a career readiness program I had begun talking to a lot of industry professionals through reaching out on LinkedIn. I was fortunate to be taken up on many of my requests to talk about the environmental industry and have since had meetings with three industry professionals. Those being the founder of a sustainability consulting start up, a sustainability lead at Amazon, and a principal engineer at the Atlanta Belt-line. The students I interviewed were Cooper MacArthur and Joaquin Friedman. 6.1 Student Interviews I’ll touch on the student interviews first: Q1: What initially sparked your interest in environmental issues? A1: Realizing how few people care especially in large industries. it’s not economically viable in most cases therefore large companies don’t care. - Cooper Summer camp, Chatahooche Nature Center – Joaquin Q2: How has your education played a role in shaping your environmental awareness and concern? A2: Not enough, we need more education and dedication to environmentalism in schools. – Cooper Took AP Environmental Science in 10th grade, opened up to issues and depth of environment. Education illuminates’ issues and ways to solve them. Turns environmentalism from an abstract aesthetic appreciation to a methodological science. – Joaquin Q3: In what ways does your environmental concern manifest in your daily life? A3: i hate large corporations with a large grudge and try to consume and purchase sustainable product. – Cooper Member of environmentally focused clubs. Read about issues and ecological news etc. – Joaquin Q4: Have you encountered any challenges in incorporating environmentally friendly practices into your life? A4: it can be more expensive for locally or sustainably resources – Cooper Reducing waste output while retaining productivity in affairs and events. Deciding what’s important and what’s not at the moment, and how much of an impact my actions truly have. – Joaquin Q5: Do you engage with a community or network of individuals who share similar environmental values? A5: yes – Cooper Very much so – Joaquin Q6: How do you see your commitment to environmental concerns evolving as you progress in your academic and professional journey? A6: they are confirmed and reassured – Cooper Hopefully becoming more powerful as my career path gives me the rescources, knowledge, and power to have real change on the environment – Joaquin Q7: If you could give advice to your peers who may be interested in becoming more environmentally conscious, what would it be? A7: go on a walk somewhere really really far away and really really secluded and absorb the nature. seriously it’s sound corny but go experience real natural beauty then imagine a large company dumping trash and oil all over the place. it’s absolutely disgusting. now imagine those companies pay millions of dollars to politicians just so they can keep doing it without any consequences. it’s awful. – Cooper Lots of people have different reasons for being environmentally conscious. Some appreciate nature for its aesthetic beauty, some for its rescources, some believe humans are a disease to the Earth. Find your reason – Joaquin 6.2 Industry Interviews While the interviews with industry professionals were much less structured, they produced ample unique insights and wisdom afforded by decades in the field. Starting with the founder of the sustainability startup, Itoro Atakpa, these were my key takeaways: • She Valued the role General Motors had in starting her career but wouldn’t know how to go back to such an unsustainable company. • Make sure to know your facts and come up with common responses to rebuttals. • Speak to people in their language, even if it’s one your unfamiliar with, such as managers in a company caring about profits so you justify sustainability through that. Much of the focus of our discussion was focused on how to best communicate environmental concern to the corporate world. Her advice was to communicate things in a language that the business world would understand. This was echoed by Sandra Elizabeth Leyva Martinez, the sustainability lead at Amazon who told me about her first job where she identified significant waste in a corporate supply chain that had been ignored. She was able to direct attention towards remediation of this waste but only after significant difficulty and numerous people trying to brush her off. Interestingly this claim of communication was rebutted by Shaun Green who struck me as the most genuinely concerned person I interviewed. He was then working on adding public transit to the Atlanta Beltline and seemed satisfied in the power of the objective good the project would create. He said it was only a matter of time till the “numbers add up” but that he wasn’t convinced this would be a project we’d see come to fruition in either of our generations. Despite the different opinions one narrative was clear between all the interviews. The fact that the environmental struggle is a collective one, and that no one is alone in this fight. "],["meta-analysis.html", "Chapter 7 Meta-Analysis 7.1 Results 7.2 Bibliography", " Chapter 7 Meta-Analysis Following a conversation with the Alpharetta City Arborist, David Shostak, I realized how much of environmentalism was focused on attempting to get people to care. It wasn’t just the important decision-making types, but generally trying to get people to consider environmentalism an important trait was a challenge across the entire industry. This was something that had stumped not only myself but the career veteran I had been speaking with, and neither of us had any real idea of how to effectively persuade people to action. A month later I was on a videocall with the sustainability director at Amazon. She expressed the same frustrations, noting how one of her first jobs as sustainability director at a manufacturing company had been excessively frustrating as she watched the company throw away billions in scrap materials every year while her objection to this wastefulness was largely ignored. Luckily however, her story does a happy ending which I found deeply reassuring. Despite the ignorance of her peers, she never stopped speaking out against the company’s needless waste, and eventually she caught the attention of the German branch of the organization. It’s not hard to observe how much farther along Europe is in the field of sustainability, and fittingly these foreign executives were appalled by the practice and put her in charge of amending the issue. She was successful and promoted within the company due to her success. I found this tale an encouraging reminder that even if your warnings may seemingly fall on deaf ears to be unapologetic in your convictions and unafraid to continue to speak out, as there are people out there who care and will listen, it may just take longer to catch their attention. Nevertheless, it would be better for everyone if more people cared about environmentalism. Anyone who’s read the iconic Lorax story understands the notion of “UNLESS.” I wanted to get at the root of what strategies have been successful in swaying one’s values, and to those aims conducted a meta-analysis on what “galvanizes people for environmental concern.” The results of this study can be found below. 7.1 Results Education and Awareness: One of the fundamental pillars in fostering environmental concern is the dissemination of knowledge. The work of Kollmuss and Agyeman (2002) emphasizes the power of education in bridging the gap between understanding environmental issues and taking proactive steps. As individuals become more informed about the consequences of their actions on the environment, a natural inclination towards environmental concern tends to emerge. Personal Relevance: The concept of personal relevance, as highlighted by Clayton (1999), adds a psychological dimension to environmental concern. When environmental issues are framed in a way that directly relates to an individual’s life, values, or aspirations, a deeper connection is established. It becomes more than a distant global problem; it becomes a personal challenge that demands attention and action. Positive Role Models: Human behavior is profoundly influenced by observation, and Schultz (2001) advocates for the power of positive role models in shaping environmental concern. By showcasing individuals who actively engage in pro-environmental behaviors, a ripple effect can occur. People are more likely to emulate behaviors they perceive as socially desirable, contributing to the normalization of sustainable practices. Social Norms: Building on the influence of societal perceptions, Schultz et al. (2007) explore the impact of social norms on environmental concern. When individuals perceive that pro-environmental behavior is a prevailing norm within their social circles, the likelihood of them adopting similar behaviors increases. This underscores the social nature of environmental concern and the importance of community influence. Incentives and Rewards: Gneezy, Meier, and Rey-Biel (2011) introduce the concept of tangible rewards as a motivational tool for pro-environmental actions. While intrinsic motivation is vital, external incentives can provide an initial push, particularly in contexts where immediate benefits are valued. The judicious use of rewards can create a positive feedback loop, reinforcing sustainable behaviors. Communication Strategies: Moser’s (2010) exploration of communication strategies acknowledges the diverse audiences engaged in environmental discourse. Effective communication requires tailoring messages to resonate with varied values and perspectives. Clarity, accessibility, and relevance are essential elements in ensuring that the information disseminated fosters a sense of urgency and personal responsibility. Community Engagement: Steg and Vlek (2009) advocate for the transformative power of community engagement. By involving individuals in environmental initiatives at the community level, a shared sense of responsibility emerges. This communal bond not only encourages immediate action but also establishes a foundation for sustained environmental concern, fostering a collective ethos of stewardship. 7.2 Bibliography Kollmuss, A., &amp; Agyeman, J.

"],["outdoor-builds-pt.-2.html", "Chapter 8 Outdoor Builds Pt. 2 8.1 Revised Plan 8.2 Progress 8.3 Next Steps", " Chapter 8 Outdoor Builds Pt. 2 On the first Friday of December, I met in the afternoon with the outdoor builds team. Unfortunately, this was scheduled the same time as an in-school showing from the drama club which coincidentally consisted of over half of the build team, leaving just a fourth of our full team to work on the project. Despite only having six people total Aiden Seabusch and I were determined to make the best use of our time. With material and planning logistics still in more of a planning stage we opted to direct the entirety of our efforts towards installment of an expensive hydroponic system that had been purchased by the PTSO, which Aiden had taken point on leading. These early decisions were pivotal to the success of the session, as without effective allocation of resources it’s entirely possible we could’ve wasted the valuable time afforded by the session, with an even greater risk of losing momentum all-together. Being flexible allowed us to be effective despite our setbacks. 8.1 Revised Plan Although Aiden and his portion of the team had already constructed much of the system during the first session, it sat stagnant in the corner of an engineering classroom rather than seeing any actual use. With about an hour and a half to work with we began planning of where to install the system. In no time at all we were huddled around the outdoor bamboo planter farthest from the cafeteria. The vegetation had been a mangled mess since the second semester of our inaugural year at IA, not to mention that the bamboo was an invasive species. That is to say that it was clear the space could be better utilized. It was the perfect spot to put the hydroponic system. 8.2 Progress William Kim and Ethan Werner went to work clearing the bamboo from the grey, concrete planter as Aiden, Ms. Paxton, and I planned how we would install the system into the bed. Chief among concerns was the system potentially sinking into the soil once filled with hundreds of gallons of water, likewise the direct contract with dirt could negatively impact the finished wood which provided support to the system. Our solution was building a sort of crosshatch platform to act as a barrier between the soil and the hydroponic system. With about an hour left in the session we began constructing the platform out of scrap wood that had left behind from the previous year’s robotics season. The wood had been outside for a long period of time meaning that, as far as I was concerned, it was conditioned to the elements. Over the next thirty minutes we finished construction of the crosshatch and placed it onto a cleared spot in the center of the planter. With the barrier in place, we hoisted the hydroponic system onto the planter and placed it safely away from any direct contact with the soil. While there’s still work to be done, especially on the front of building the outdoor furniture, this was a powerful symbol of progress that helped the project maintain a sense of momentum and progress. 8.3 Next Steps From here I plan to finalize outdoor furniture plans with the rest of the team over Christmas break and have something to jump start this next semester. Even as we worked on the adjacent hydroponics project, I was able to communicate these plans to members of the team and keep the momentum rolling on numerous fronts. This matter of momentum is what successful projects come down to. Often small successes are exactly what you need to avoid larger stagnation.

Within each chapter are descriptions, guides, and reflections on environmental projects I participated in during my time as a student. 1.1 Usage While the book is targeted at students from Innovation Academy, it can be used as a source of inspiration for students in many different situations. Even for the IA student, this should not be read as a manual to be followed, but as a piece to be used for advice and direction in navigating projects similar to my own.

Their students came and toured our campus and frankly I’m not sure which school it was, but I believe they were here to observe a “vocational” school in another country. As someone who was not directly involved with the visit it was rather forgettable. That was until I received an email from Ms. Paxton over the summer: an invitation to the “New Taipei City: Carbon Neutral Summit”, also known as New Taipei City MAGIC. MAGIC being an acronym for “Maker, Action, Green, International, and Cross-domain.” It was an exciting opportunity which I promptly agreed to. It wouldn’t be until August that I would hear more about the project, and we quickly organized and began brainstorming. Staying two hours after school I, along with Joaquin Friedman, Cyrus Zhou, Sejal Whitaker, Lauren Trute, and Megan Roka came deliberated over what would become our project. This presented the first point in the project where we really could’ve gone about things better. Deciding what problem to focus on took much longer than anticipated, and ultimately, we were left with a half-baked topic. It came down to High Density Polyethylene recycling using a solar oven, or a personal seaweed growing system for urban agriculture. We decided to split into groups and take a week to research the individual projects before coming together for a subsequent debate. Neither group did a whole lot of research, and we ended up deciding on the seaweed growing system due to the potential to talk about urban agriculture in our presentation which was a largely under-discussed topic in the sustainability field, especially for this summit, which from what we saw was dominated by gimmicky inventions that couldn’t really apply to the world outside of pure hypotheticals. The submission requirements for the project asked for both a written document and a developed project, however the due dates were about a month apart. Naturally we started with the written document as by the time we decided on the project subject it would be due in just two weeks. We met on the next Flex Friday and spent the morning session researching the benefits of urban agriculture as well as the health effects of adding seaweed to a diet. Both were interesting topics, and by far the opportunity to research these fields were the most memorable takeaways from this project. Not being able to finish during the session we went to work over the coming two weeks, finishing just in time and getting the document submitted. 2.1 Plan Revision A few days after submitting the written plan we received an email from a correspondent NTPC forum. They informed us that rather than a limit of 10 pages as was described in the instructions we were provided; the limit was instead 2 pages. Fortunately, we were given a few more days to update the written plan, but this was a frustrating development. Over the course of the next week, I worked with Cyrus Zhou to condense the written plan down to just 2 pages. It was unfortunate to have to have to take out all of the work we had done, but it wasn’t a complete waste as the information removed from the written plan was still useful for the presentation and fabrication of the project. Finding information on the forum was one of the most difficult aspects of the project and required numerous hours of searching around online to find resources to draw examples from. As this is something I hope we continue to participate in for the foreseeable future I’ve attached all the links I was able to find in my search below: https://www.youtube.com/@sheng_jutseng8277 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8PszsL86tQ&amp;ab_channel=Peggiehunge https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ZL_759GhU&amp;ab_channel=%E9%99%B6%E5%B7%A5%E7%A7%91%E4%B8%BB%E4%BB%BB%E5%85%AC%E5%8B%99%E4%BF%A1%E7%AE%B1%E6%96%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%B8%82%E9%B6%AF%E6%AD%8C%E5%B7%A5%E5%95%86 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjC_zZYYXmA&amp;ab_channel=%E6%96%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%B8%82%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E5%B1%80 https://www.ntpc.gov.tw/ch/home.jsp?id=e8ca970cde5c00e1&amp;dataserno=8a975b566bbfea08c6c8c2c76f8fcc16 https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/10/18/2003724177 https://news.immigration.gov.tw/NewsSection/Detail/0a7bd59c-a892-4b26-a0f7-325fd09df71a?category=9&amp;lang=EN https://legacy.sccoe.org/sccsba/docs/news/Newsletter_2023_1.pdf https://sites.google.com/ctjhs.ntpc.edu.tw/ntpc-magic/about-us?authuser=0 https://www.ntpc.edu.tw/home.jsp?id=d127e0ce0f4f407b&amp;act=be4f48068b2b0031&amp;dataserno=ebbffbc12d05d323f3b7507b07de71ee https://youtu.be/CjC_zZYYXmA?t=14442 2.2 Building the Prototype With the written plan submitted we got started on the physical prototype, the second step of the project submission requirements. For future submissions to the NTPC forum I recommend placing the feasibility of creation at the forefront of your project decision. In our case it was more of an afterthought, which presented some unique challenges. The first challenge was having to adapt our design to materials we already had. We had to do this due to starting the building too late and not possessing enough funds to acquire exactly every material we wanted. This manifested itself in the building process through requiring we use a tank designed for aquaponics, as well as grow lights and a pump instead of a protein skimmer and macroalgae as we had designed. For a speedily constructed prototype these were perfectly fine accommodations and did not significantly affect the product. The second challenge was getting the seaweed to grow in the tank. We had to order the seaweed online and by the time it got here we needed to put it in very quickly and didn’t have enough foundational knowledge to ensure it adapted well to the conditions of the tank. Luckily it was able to survive well, and as you can see in the image only a fraction of the seaweed floated up to the top, while the rest was able to connect with the rocks at the bottom and begin growing normally. A third issue was these rocks themselves. The calcium coming off the rocks resulted in an extremely foggy water, making visibility difficult which we’d need to fix to be able to present. This was chiefly due to the rocks we purchased and the way we ended up fixing this was through aggressive washing of the rocks over the course of an hour. The final hurdle we had to address was the salinity of the water. We purchased aquarium salt for the tank but upon reading the back found that the measurements provided were for freshwater. The seaweed naturally required the salinity of seawater to thrive in our tank. After numerous pH tests we were able to center in on the salinity, however this would’ve been made far less stressful and rushed with ample foreground research, which is my main piece of advice for future students participating in the forum. 2.3 Presentation Finding ourselves at the tail-end of the project we had now completed the written plan as well as the physical prototype, and now we only had to finish the recorded presentation of our work. This was required as Fulton County had declined any possibility of travel to Taipei, not that it would’ve been feasible regardless of their decision. Over the course of the project motivation presented a consistent challenge towards completion. This is true of any project, but I’ve observed it can be especially potent in projects such as these with an environmental or more broadly a sort of counter-cultural focus. Environmentalism is often not the popular stance for a variety of reasons out of scope of this reflection, and because of this unpopularity the execution of these projects requires a lot of intrinsic motivation. This was something we were fortunate to possess a satisfactory quantity of, even if only marginally so. Because of this I encourage you to support your colleagues in these endeavors as work can often feel thankless despite its importance. Creating the presentation and recording were hindered and slowed by this lack of motivation. We were fortunate to have Joaquin Freidman take lead of the project and ensure everyone kept up enough effort to see the project through to completion. With the deadline on the horizon, we finished the PowerPoint and selected three members of the team to present in the video. There was a preference for underclassmen but unfortunately, we weren’t able to drum enough interest for the project due to not starting work soon enough. Aiden Seabusch, Lauren Trute, and Joaquin Freidman came together on during the tutoring session of the Flex Friday a week before the deadline and recorded the video. Unfortunately, the video was rough, and it wasn’t something we felt confident about presenting to the summit, prompting a second take. Because this was our school’s first year participating in this annual event, we really wanted to ensure we presented our best work. After refining the PowerPoint and recording a second take, we were left with something we were proud of. We reviewed the video and made sure it was good and submitted it to the correspondent. The video was in and with it the final part of the project. Participating in the NTPC Summit represented a great opportunity to share ideas with students from around the world and get our name out there in the environmental space. If you have the opportunity to participate I’d highly recommend it, especially if you’re able to travel to Taipei! "],["outdoor-classroom-project-ptso-grant.html", "Chapter 3 Outdoor Classroom Project &amp; PTSO Grant 3.1 Planning 3.2 Approaching Deadlines 3.3 Design Methodology 3.4 Isometric Sketches", " Chapter 3 Outdoor Classroom Project &amp; PTSO Grant Approached by Ms. Paxton in early September I was given the opportunity to lead a team in designing furniture for an outdoor space at our school. This was an exciting offer coming off the heels of a failed grant application towards the end of my junior year which was going to be used for development of an outdoor classroom. This project wouldn’t create all our idealized designs; however, it would represent an important step, which often in pursuing goals of environmentalism, taking small steps is important. You’re not going to start a revolution while in high school, but we do have the means to influence our surroundings in meaningful ways, and in turn plant the seeds necessary to change people’s minds for the better. I’d be looking at about a thousand dollars of grant money, which was more than enough to create a solid set of durable furniture fitted for use by multiple students at a time. 3.1 Planning The team met for the first time on the first engineering Flex Friday of the year. During the session we introduced ourselves then went out to the space to evaluate the area we’d be developing. We found barren, dry soil and a lot of sunlight. We went back to our meeting room and began brainstorming. We wanted to create a design that could interact with the soil and help remediate it. With no design settled on by the end of the first meeting we decided on a future date to meet again and debriefed with the goal of producing our own designs on our own and deciding based on those. 3.2 Approaching Deadlines A few days later I was informed that the PTSO grant deadline was far closer than we had thought. I’d have only five days to decide on a design and the grant paperwork submitted. This was a valuable learning opportunity, and it forced me to be both resilient and adaptive. Thinking on your feet is necessary of good leadership and acting that out I created a Microsoft Form with four different options of furniture based on images I found on Pinterest. This was done to preserve the democratic nature of the project, as I knew that if I made the call all on my own it would alienate everyone else in the project and keeping them engaged was of vital importance to ensure competition of the project as well as inspiring many of the underclassmen participating in the development. Two days after the form was posted I collected the results and went to work creating the design. It would be a table with two benches, and a raised bed centered in the table. The raised bed would allow interaction with the soil and help remediate the soil quality through higher quality soil maintained on top of it. 3.3 Design Methodology The design was created based on posts found on Pinterest as well as building plans and YouTube videos. In the end I decided on a simple design that could result in almost all the pieces being made of 2x4s, making construction and purchase of the materials very simple. Consisting mainly of long 2x4 planks the itemized list was created and submitted to the PTSO the next day. After filling out a few text boxes detailing the motivations of the project, it was finished, and the grant submitted. 3.4 Isometric Sketches "],["nature-trail.html", "Chapter 4 Nature Trail 4.1 Beginning 4.2 Bridge Construction 4.3 Refinement 4.4 Deeper Reflection", " Chapter 4 Nature Trail Created initially in 2022 by the Innovation Academy Environmental Stewardship and Mountain Biking Clubs, the nature trail is a mixed-use trail out behind the school which follows from the retention pond over a wooden bridge then to the auxiliary soccer field and back around. The nature trail represents some of the most substantial environmental work done thus far at the school, and it’s been an extremely rewarding experience to see the trail grow and development over time. 4.1 Beginning I began work on the trail volunteering with the Environmental Stewardship club to cleanup construction debris leftover from the demolition of old Milton Highschool. As we pulled up the metal pipes and discarded net, we found that the area would make an excellent nature trail, and Joaquin Freidman, Parker Grodi, and Wasim Alam began work designing the trail and planning out the route, though at this point the path was still extremely rough and not fit for a walking trail, let alone a mountain biking trail. 4.2 Bridge Construction Later in spring of 2022 the Environmental Stewardship club began work on a bridge to gap the river between the retention pond and auxiliary soccer field. This process consisted of multiple steps: Clearing out the area with branch cutters and pulling weeds and brush that was in the way of the bridge placement. Create the bridge out of 2x4s and stronger wooden posts. Digging holes for the wooden posts, making sure to work around roots encountered while digging. Pouring cement around the posts to ensure the bridge is sturdy. Once the posts are sturdy the bridge was affixed to the posts, and at last it was finished. 4.3 Refinement Even after constructing the bridge the nature trail still needed work. We came back over the summer and conducted more landscaping, clearing out fallen branches and using them to better define the path. After some weed-whacking the trail started looking a lot better. It was finally something that could be used by the public. Graphics were designed for a trail sign and a wooden post was designed to hold the graphic. Now it looked like a professional trail. This is essentially where we’re at today. Currently we’re looking into adding a doggy-bag station to make the trail more accessible to dog-walkers, as well as continuing to refine the upkeep of the trail. 4.4 Deeper Reflection My favorite part of the trail is that it’s something that could be around for as long as IA, and even beyond that. It gives the Environmental Stewardship club an opportunity to give new members hands-on experience and help foster a passion for the environment through interacting with it directly. There’s not better way to communicate our own passions than by sharing it with others and letting it experience it for themselves. The Mountain Biking Trail club currently holds some of the best underclassmen leadership and engagement, and it gives me hope for the future of the trail, and likewise the future of environmentalism within Innovation Academy. "],["shadowing-the-arborist.html", "Chapter 5 Shadowing the Arborist 5.1 Day of the Shadowing 5.2 Combatting to Greenwashing", " Chapter 5 Shadowing the Arborist One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned at my time at IA is how people are so much more willing to help you than you think, it’s just a matter of reaching out. I learned this when I first reached out to the Alpharetta City Arborist, David Shostak, asking about planting trees for an outdoor classroom project we were planning. Feeling inspired, the email I sent was ambitious and asked about potential interest in working with our school aside from just answering my questions about the trees. I didn’t expect much and was surprised when he responded and said he would be delighted to help. This led to a series of emails which in the scope of Junior year, resulted in a Q&amp;A session being organized for members of the environmental stewardship club. I made sure to keep in contact and through that endeavor forged a valuable connection with years of experience in the environmental industry. We’ve met numerous times since then and have begun planning new opportunities for students such as volunteering to help with a corporate-funded tree-giveaway, as well as looking into more sustainable sources of buying wood for the engineering program. This has offered not only enhanced means of making the school more environmentally sustainable but exposing me personally to the environmental industry. 5.1 Day of the Shadowing October 12th was the day I shadowed Mr. Shostak. City hall had always been such an illusive building, and for the first time I would be not only going inside, but into the areas permitted for staff members only. It was an exciting experience, and I was glad to see Mr. Shostak was similarly enthused about my shadowing. That’s something imperative to understand that a lot of these professionals don’t receive interest in their fields often, especially when you’re looking at a more niche field such as environmental careers. We discussed leading technologies in the industry such as using x-ray to evaluate tree roots without having to physically harm them in any way. It was interesting to see what his work looked like, which was really a lot of consulting and arguing with independent contractors. He took me to an “infraction site” where a demolition company had placed a root barrier, meant to protect tree roots, on top of the roots, effectively severing them. The demolition contractor said it was the homeowner’s mistake that had caused the issue as he was trying to avoid the hefty fines, he would be subject to if the trees needed to be removed due to infection. Mr. Shostak told me about how this line of work you must be vigilant for “BS,” something I realized can be applied to all domains of environmentalism. 5.2 Combatting to Greenwashing Greenwashing has become a prominent term in the vocabulary for environmentalism, it describes how corporations and individuals who present harm to the environment “promote” environmentalism for perverse causes. This has been seen most bluntly with big oil companies but continues to most corporations aside from a select few who find more profit in a genuine care for the environment such as many outdoor wear companies. Resilience to these greenwashing attempts is strengthened by building a community with others with a genuine passion. That’s why it’s so important to seek out these connections and not be afraid to reach out to others, because they’re a lot more interested in talking to you than you would think they are.
